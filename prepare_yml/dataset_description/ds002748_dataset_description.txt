This resting-state fMRI dataset is organized strictly according to the BIDS v1.0.2 standard and includes both high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scans and closed-eyes resting-state BOLD fMRI for every participant. My goal is to implement a comprehensive, high-quality preprocessing pipeline that spans structural processing—such as cortical surface reconstruction and tissue segmentation—and functional processing—such as slice-timing correction, motion correction, despiking, physiological and tissue-signal regression, temporal filtering, spatial normalization to MNI space, and spatial smoothing—so that I can accurately compute resting-state metrics like Functional Connectivity (FC), Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuation (ALFF), Regional Homogeneity (ReHo), and Voxel-Mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC). 
Each anatomical image (stored under sub-<participant_id>/anat/sub-<participant_id>_T1w.nii.gz) will serve both for precise gray/white/CSF segmentation and as the target for coregistration of functional data, while each BOLD run (stored under sub-<participant_id>/func/sub-<participant_id>_task-rest_bold.nii.gz) was acquired with a TR of 2.5 s, TE of 0.035 s, 25 slice-timing offsets, flip angle of 90°, 100 volumes per run, and 25 slices per volume—information that enables accurate slice-timing correction and optimal choice of filter bands (e.g., 0.01–0.08 Hz for ALFF). 
The cohort comprises 72 subjects—51 with mild depression and 21 healthy controls—with demographic and clinical data detailed in participants.tsv and participants.json. 
To support FC analysis, I will apply rigorous motion correction and artifact removal (including CompCor or similar regressors); for ALFF/fALFF I will use appropriate band-pass filtering; for ReHo I will calculate local signal synchrony in individual space followed by smoothing; and for VMHC I will ensure precise, symmetric interhemispheric registration. Finally, surface-based processing (e.g., via FreeSurfer’s recon-all) will be incorporated where beneficial. 
By tailoring parameters such as motion threshold values, the number of principal components for noise regressors, filter cutoff frequencies, smoothing kernel sizes, and FreeSurfer flags to these downstream goals, the pipeline will maximize data quality and validity for all subsequent analyses. Let me know which preprocessing module you’d like to configure first.
