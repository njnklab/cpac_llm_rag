You are an expert in fMRI data preprocessing and neuroimage registration. You understand different strategies for normalizing functional data to a standard space, including direct EPI-to-template registration. Your recommendations should consider the trade-offs between different normalization pathways and the overall goal of achieving accurate spatial correspondence for group analyses.

I have a BIDS-compliant resting-state fMRI dataset which includes T1-weighted anatomical images and BOLD fMRI data for each subject. My primary planned registration pathway involves coregistering BOLD to the subject's T1w, and then registering the T1w to a standard template (e.g., MNI T1w template). However, I am also exploring parameters for direct BOLD EPI to an EPI template registration. My overall goal is comprehensive preprocessing for advanced resting-state analyses (FC, ALFF, ReHo, VMHC). Please carefully consider the following dataset description:

[--- BEGIN DATASET DESCRIPTION (from dataset_description.txt) ---]
{PASTE THE CONTENT OF YOUR dataset_description.txt HERE}
[--- END DATASET DESCRIPTION ---]

Based on the dataset description above, my primary registration strategy, and my overall analysis goals, I need you to recommend settings for the following parameters related to direct functional EPI to EPI template registration (`registration_workflows.functional_registration.EPI_registration`). For each parameter, provide the recommended setting and a clear, concise `reason` for your choice. Consider if this step is complementary or redundant given the primary T1w-mediated registration path.

Here are the configuration block and parameters:

**配置块: `registration_workflows.functional_registration.EPI_registration`**
- **参数:** `run`
    - **功能:** 是否运行功能像直接到EPI模板的配准。
    - **可选项:** `On`, `Off`
    - **默认值:** `Off`
- **参数:** `using`
    - **功能:** 选择用于EPI直接配准的方法/工具。这是一个 "fork option"。
    - **可选项 (列表形式):**
        - `'ANTS'` (ANTs SyN 非线性配准)
        - `'FSL'` (FSL FNIRT 非线性配准)
        - `'FSL-linear'` (FSL FLIRT 线性配准)
    - **默认值:** `['ANTS']`
- **参数:** `interpolation`
    - **功能:** 输出变换后的EPI图像时使用的插值方法。
    - **可选项:** `'Linear'`, `'BSpline'`, `'LanczosWindowedSinc'`
    - **默认值:** `'LanczosWindowedSinc'`

Please provide your response in a single JSON object. The JSON should have a top-level key for the configuration block (`registration_workflows.functional_registration.EPI_registration`). Under this key, there should be an object for each parameter, containing `value` and `reason`.

Example JSON structure:
```json
{
  "registration_workflows.functional_registration.EPI_registration": {
    "run": {
      "value": "Off",
      "reason": "..."
    },
    "using": {
      "value": ["ANTS"],
      "reason": "..."
    },
    "interpolation": {
      "value": "LanczosWindowedSinc",
      "reason": "..."
    }
  }
